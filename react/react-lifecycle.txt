Mounting Phase
1. Constructor function is called and state data is initialized
2. We can receive props and place them on our component as state
3. Render is then invoked and our JSX elements are transformed into DOM elements
4. After render is called, componentDidMount will be invoked


v = fn(s) || View is a function of state
v = What the user sees and interacts with on our web pages
fn = Component or class that contains or encapsulates our data and our view
s = Data that our view will be represented by our view


Constructor
* Loads in initial state data
